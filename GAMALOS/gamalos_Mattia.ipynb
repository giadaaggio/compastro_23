In fact, by simply adding a third particle the unknowns become 18, and the constants/integrals of motion are not enough to reduce the complexity of the problem. We have then to add constraints in order to achieve an analitic solution, and this analitic solution is known only for a small amount of cases (e.g. circular restricted three body problem). Therefore, we use numerical methods in order to integrate this system of differential equation. \n",

In this way only particles from nearby cells need to be treated individually, whereas particles from distant cells can be assimilated with the super-particle described before. In this way the complexity of the problem is reduced from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N logN)$. In order to discriminate nearby from far-away particles we can introduce the concept of opening angle.
