In fact, by simply adding a third particle the unknowns become 18, and the constants/integrals of motion are not enough to reduce the complexity of the problem. Then constrains have to be added in order to achieve an analitic solution, and this analitic solution is known only for a small amount of cases (e.g. circular restricted three body problem). Therefore, numerical methods are used in order to integrate this system of differential equations. \n",
