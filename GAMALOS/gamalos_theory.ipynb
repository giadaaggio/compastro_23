In fact, by simply adding a third particle the unknowns become 18, and the constants/integrals of motion are not enough to reduce the complexity of the problem. Then constrains have to be added in order to achieve an analitic solution, and this analitic solution is known only for a small amount of cases (e.g. circular restricted three body problem).

    "With this project it was possible to have a very simplified overview of how two galaxies mutually interacting evolve with time. After checking the stability of one galaxy alone, its rotation curve and its surface density profile, we created a second galaxy, equal to the second one but translated and with an initial velocity different from zero. Then, we simulated three galactic encounters. The first one was an encounter between two galaxies rotating in the same direction and laying in the same plane; the second was an encounter between two galaxies rotating in opposite directions, and the third one was an encounter between two galaxies rotating in the same direction and laying in different planes. All the simulation was integrated in a time equal to two times the rotation period of the galaxy itself. \\\n",
    "From these simulations we obtained the formation of well defined structures in all the three cases, that we associated with stellar currents. The counter-rotating case highlighted a more complicated structure; in particular, while one galaxies still shows two well defined elongated structures, for the second galaxy structures are not straightforward to recognize. Finally, in the inclined case, beside the formation of clear structures the most noticeable thing was the appearence of a new component for the velocity along z, since the problem passed from being 2D to being 3D. \n",

    "We can finally think of some implementation to this problem that can be done. In particular:\n",
    "- we could think of considering an additional velocity gaussian component due to random motions when generating the initial condition; this should be quite straightforward to implement;\n",
    "- we could think of adding some new components to the galaxies, for example a NFW potential for the DM halo, an Hernquist potential for the bulge and a Miyamoto-Nagai potential for the disk. Anyway, This is a trifle more complicated because we also have to account that the potential is moving with the galaxy, so we need to implement a potential which position is varying in time. Furthermore, I have to insert these potentials both in the initial conditions generator and in the algoritm to compute the acceleration. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we recognize that this is a very simplified model for a galaxy for many reasons, for example that considers the all mass centered in the centre, which is the source of a plummer potential, or that we did not consider any other component (dark matter halo, ulge, bars...) ecc...; anyway, whith all this in mind, the outcomes of the simulations still gives some first idea of how a galactic encounter works.
